## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau Public
- CSV dataset (Airbnb NYC Open Dataset)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## Tableau Analysis Details
- Applied price filtering to handle extreme outliers and improve visual interpretability
- Used distribution plots (histogram, boxplot) to analyze skewed price data
- Explored relationships between price and demand using scatter plots
- Built an interactive dashboard with global filters for room type and area
- Focused on clarity, consistency, and analytical storytelling rather than visual overload

---

## Calculated Fields
- Created simple calculated fields to support exploratory analysis (e.g. price-based comparisons and availability indicators).
